						<span class="highlight">EVOLVE</span> is one of five well-being programs in Dimensions’ foundational repertoire. Your Retreat time with us will enrich your knowledge with relevant, in-depth training, provide better care for your clients and feel more confident in the work you do as a therapist and wellness practitioner. Our leaders in the fields of psychotherapy, wellness and psychedelics will instruct you in best practices to ensure the highest levels of integrity, ethics and safety. You will gain new skills and receive certification in evidence-based psychedelic therapies, techniques and methods. We focus on mindfulness techniques that psychedelic therapists and guides can use to deepen their own healing and transformation process while assisting and staying in full contact with their client for many hours. These internal skill sets are often unacknowledged in other programs, yet are essential in increasing personal and professional sustainability and resilience.

				<p>Dimensions Algonquin Highlands can be reached from Toronto by car, helicopter or private air. Driving from Toronto via Highway 400 North with a connection to Highway 118 West brings guests to our door in approximately three hours. From Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport or Toronto Pearson International Airport, flight time to the nearby Stanhope Municipal Airport (CND4) is one hour. The Retreat spans nearly 40 acres of woodlands, and is located in Stanhope Township along the shores of Maple Lake, at 1218 Canopy Lane. This forest access road leads south from the Township’s Airport Road, just 6 kilometres from the nearest community of Carnarvon and 20 kilometres from the larger town of Minden, Ontario. </p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>“Our lakeside Northern Ontario setting featuring rugged hills and an extensive network of forest trails is the optimal setting to observe the first signs of a Canadian spring. Time spent with us off the beaten path will serve as an exclusive prelude to Dimensions Education’s growing curriculum and the opening of a global collection of several permanent Retreat destinations for deep healing and well-being. You will learn why the combination of natural plant medicines and psychotherapeutic technique is a powerful strategy to address issues and reduce the impact of trauma – especially when healing is set in natural surroundings.“</p>

						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>Because the training is cannabis-specific, and in the USA cannabis is still considered federally as a schedule 1 substance, there are some constraints and CMM has not offered these as CE credits yet in the USA. There may be greater opportunity for practitioners based in Canada. However, all CMM certificates of completion will denote the total hours of the training program and these have been successfully used as education and training hour requirements for professional licenses. </p>

						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>Published trials and recent research show that psychedelics are useful in treating depression, anxiety, stress, trauma, addictions, migraines, post-traumatic stress, obsessive–compulsive disorder, eating disorders and end-of-life distress, as well as in improving general well-being. Importantly, psychedelics also show promise in safely and efficiently treating many of these conditions where other approaches have failed.
							</p>
							<p>In conjunction with Queen’s University and Health Canada, Dimensions is developing a robust research agenda to continue exploring the benefits and limits of psychedelics. Read our blog for more information about current research trials and findings.</p>

						<label class="tab-label" for="qa-chck9"><span> Which psychedelics do you offer?</span> </label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>Dimensions believes in whole plant medicine. The type of plant-based psychedelics offered at our safe, legal and luxurious Retreats differs depending on local laws in the regions where our locations operate.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="tab">

						<label class="tab-label" for="qa-chck10"><span> Are psychedelics legal?</span> </label>

						<input type="checkbox" id="qa-chck11">
						<label class="tab-label" for="qa-chck11"><span> How do psychedelics work?</span></label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>When used therapeutically in professionally supervised treatments, psychedelics can help you safely explore past experiences and memories that are normally difficult to tolerate or access. By quieting the part of the brain associated with ego, psychedelics disrupt patterns of negative thinking and allow for the creation of new perceptions. In these expanded states of consciousness, you’re better able to develop – and maintain – a deeper, more compassionate sense of yourself and your place in the world, leading to better mental health and improved well-being.</p>

					<div class="tab">
						<input type="checkbox" id="qa-chck12">
						<label class="tab-label" for="qa-chck12"><span> How safe are psychedelics?</span></label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>Used therapeutically, psychedelics are low-risk. At Dimensions, safety is our priority. We incorporate multiple measures to optimize your wellness journey and ensure your stay with us is safe and effective from beginning to end.</p>

					<div class="tab">
						<input type="checkbox" id="qa-chck13">
						<label class="tab-label" for="qa-chck13"><span> What is psychedelic-assisted therapy?</span></label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>Psychedelic-assisted therapy combines psychedelic experiences with complementary therapeutic processes to help you reflect, reset and reconnect. </p>
							<p>The therapeutic effects of psychedelics are not due simply to their physiological effects. Rather, they are the result of interactions between these physiological effects, the therapeutic setting and your mindset. Dimensions wellness programs offer a diverse array of therapeutic somatic modalities such as massage, float tanks and acupuncture to help you reconnect to your body. Instruction in breathing, meditation, mindfulness and similar practices deepens your experience. Activities in nature, exceptional culinary selections and the serene design at our luxurious Retreats are essential supports on your journey to well-being. Through all of these elements, our expert team pays careful attention to your emotional, physical, mental and spiritual development.</p>

					<div class="tab">
						<input type="checkbox" id="qa-chck14">
						<label class="tab-label" for="qa-chck14"><span> Does cannabis really have psychedelic properties?</span> </label>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>When specific strains of cannabis sativa are blended together in a particular way, their psychoactive components – notably, THC, CBD, CBN, CBG and CBC, as well as the terpene profile – can elicit deep psychedelic states similar to other classic psychedelics such as ayahuasca and psilocybin. When used in a therapeutic or ceremonial setting, cannabis addresses physical traumas in the fascia, tendons, muscles and bones – not just the trauma held in nervous system memories, emotions and personality structures.</p>
							<p>However, cannabis differs from other psychedelics because you can retain your agency or sense of control. This often means you can navigate the experience more skilfully and with greater ease, and you can pause the experience. </p>
